class SimpleThermoPkg(BaseFBAPkg):
    """Loop-law constraints: flux may only run down a potential gradient.

    Each metabolite gets a potential p_m and each internal reaction a dgp_r = sum_m S_mr p_m (the
    'dgpc' row). The sign of dgp_r is then tied to the direction of the reaction's flux. Here the
    potentials are free; FullThermoPkg pins those of metabolites with a known formation energy.

    The coupling has to be STRICT, with a margin eps > 0:

        forward flux  ->  dgp_r <= -eps        reverse flux  ->  dgp_r >= +eps

    With eps = 0 -- this package's behaviour before the `dg_margin` parameter existed -- the rows
    read dgp <= 0 / dgp >= 0, and setting every potential to zero makes every dgp zero and
    satisfies all of them whatever the fluxes are. The constraints then exclude nothing: not
    even an internal cycle with no net conversion, which is the one thing loop-law constraints
    are for. A cycle is excluded because the dgp of its reactions must sum to zero around it,
    and they cannot if each one carrying flux must be at least eps below zero.

    Two ways to tie the margin to flux are offered (`coupling`):

    "revbin"  One binary per reaction (RevBinPkg): b = 1 allows forward flux and forces
              dgp <= -eps; b = 0 allows reverse flux and forces dgp >= +eps. Every internal
              reaction must then sit at least eps from equilibrium, including reactions that
              carry no flux. This is loopless FBA (Schellenberger, Lewis & Palsson 2011). With
              free potentials that costs nothing; with pinned potentials (FullThermoPkg) a
              reaction whose attainable dG lies entirely inside (-eps, eps) makes the model
              infeasible even if it never carries flux.

    "tmfa"    Two binaries per reaction, forward-active zf and reverse-active zr, at most one
              of them on: zf = 1 forces dgp <= -eps, zr = 1 forces dgp >= +eps, and with both
              off the reaction carries no flux and its dgp is unconstrained. The margin applies
              only to reactions that carry flux (TMFA, Henry, Broadbelt & Hatzimanikatis 2007).
              It excludes the same cycles and cannot be made infeasible by an idle reaction.

    Both big-M terms must stay above what the solver can resolve. A binary is accepted as
    integral within the solver's integrality tolerance tau, so the dgp side can slip by
    tau * (max_potential + eps), which must stay well below eps. The package warns when the slip
    reaches a tenth of eps: with max_potential 10000 and eps 1 that is tau >= 1e-5, which is
    Gurobi's own default; cobra sets 1e-7, a slip of 0.001. The flux side can carry up to
    tau * big-M through an "off" direction; tighten tau or use the solver's integrality-focus
    setting if that matters.

    Build after the final reaction bounds are set. "tmfa" reads them at build time: it gives a
    direction a binary only if the bounds allow flux that way, and caps that flux at the big-M.
    A reaction blocked at build and reopened later has no thermo rows in that direction, and a
    bound widened later is capped at the old one. "revbin" relies on RevBinPkg, whose flux big-M
    is a fixed 1000. Building again replaces the coupling rows, so a rebuild with another
    coupling, margin or filter does not leave the previous one's rows behind.

    Parameters (build_package):
        dg_margin      eps, in the units of the potentials -- kJ/mol under FullThermoPkg,
                       arbitrary here. Default 1. 0 restores the old, vacuous behaviour.
        coupling       "revbin" (default) or "tmfa", as above.
        max_potential  bound on each potential and dgp, and the big-M of the dgp side.
        flux_big_m     big-M of the flux side for "tmfa"; None (default) uses each reaction's
                       own largest bound magnitude.
        filter         if given, only these reactions get thermo rows.
        exclude_reactions  reactions to leave unconstrained.
    Exchange (EX_), sink (SK_) and demand (DM_) reactions are never constrained: they cross the
    system boundary, so a potential difference across them has no meaning here. Nor are
    reactions with no metabolites, whose dgp is 0 and so can never clear the margin.
