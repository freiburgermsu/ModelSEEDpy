"""ElementClosurePkg -- the network may not create chemical elements.

For each element E one linear row, over the reactions that cross the system boundary:

    sum over boundary and biomass reactions r of  -imb_E(r) * v_r   <=  0

where imb_E(r) is the net number of E atoms reaction r produces per unit flux. An exchange
that exports a compound "destroys" its atoms (imb < 0), so the row reads: E leaving through
exchanges, sinks and demands, plus E retained in biomass, may not exceed E entering.

Why the boundary is enough. At steady state S v = 0, so for ANY assignment a of atom counts to
metabolites, a^T S v = 0: the net creation of E by internal reactions equals minus its net
creation by boundary and biomass reactions. Forbidding net creation at the boundary therefore
forbids it inside, whatever the internal mechanism -- including reactions whose own balance
cannot even be computed because a reactant carries an R group or a placeholder formula. One row
per element, no binaries.

What it catches and what it does not.
  - Mass-imbalanced reactions or combinations that create atoms -- e.g. two versions of one
    enzymatic step that differ by a CO2, which together emit CO2 from nothing. Thermodynamic
    (loop-law) constraints cannot catch these: such a pathway is not a cycle, and creating CO2
    "from nothing" looks downhill to every formation-energy model.
  - NOT charge-only imbalances that create electrons with no atoms (e.g. carrier pairs that
    differ in how many ferredoxins they reduce). Set charge=True to add a charge row; expect it
    to expose every charge-imbalanced reaction a model relies on.
  - It forbids net creation, not every imbalance: a reaction that creates an element may run if
    another destroys as much (the net is what reaches the boundary). imbalanced_reactions()
    lists the culprits so they can be curated.

Biomass. Biomass is a sink that keeps atoms. Its content is computed from its components; the
biomass token (cpd11416, which every biomass reaction emits and sinks remove) carries none, so
nothing is counted twice and member-level biomass sinks in a community are covered. Macromolecule
pseudo-compounds -- Protein, DNA, RNA, ACP -- have placeholder formulas (C4H5N2O3R2 for Protein),
so each is given the content of the reaction that synthesises it from formulated precursors. A
carrier with no producer (apo-ACP, which biomass releases as it consumes ACP) is zero, which makes
the pair count only the moiety actually incorporated.

Atom assignment (one, used everywhere): biomass token -> 0; formula without R -> its atoms;
biomass pseudo-compound -> content of its synthesis reaction; any other formula with R -> its
explicit atoms (R taken as the same unspecified moiety on both sides of a reaction); no formula
-> 0, and listed in `unformulated`.

Parameters (build_package):
    elements          which elements get a row. Default "all": every element the boundary and
                      biomass compounds contain, metals included (about 20 rows; on 403 member
                      models it costs ~7 ms more to build than C, H, O and no measurable solve
                      time). Also accepted: a string of symbols ("C,H,O" or "C H O N"), or any
                      iterable of symbols.
                      Unknown symbols raise ValueError. See parse_elements.
    charge            also close charge. Default False.
    sense             "le" (default): no net creation, destruction allowed -- biomass may keep
                      atoms, and so may sinks. "eq": neither.
    exempt_reactions  {reaction id: reason} -- reactions whose own imbalance is allowed (e.g. a
                      known stoichiometric error awaiting curation that growth depends on). Every
                      other reaction stays closed. Their metabolites must have formulas.
    biomass_reactions ids; default: every reaction that produces a biomass token.
    biomass_tokens    ModelSEED ids of biomass tokens. Default ("cpd11416",).
